# ajs-3.2-bind-method
Advanced JavaScript | Workshop 3 Task 2

Download the workshop3.zip file from Moodle and extract it to your workspace. In workshop3.js, use bind() to amend the code from the Question 2a so that:

• The test() function returns the value: Tom.
• A new function is created as a copy of getName (call it test2) which will return the value: Jane.

Summary: it is all about which object you bind the method to!
